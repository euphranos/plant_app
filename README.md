# Tap to Earn - Flutter Game

Tap to Earn is a simple clicker game where players grow a plant by tapping on the screen and earn tokens. The goal of the game is to grow the plant as much as possible by tapping and accumulating the highest score.

## How It Works

- **Tapping**: Each tap on the screen causes the plant to grow.
- **Plant Growth**: The number of taps required for the plant to grow, as well as the difficulty level, can be adjusted via variables in the code.
- **Earning Tokens**: Players earn tokens as the plant grows.

## Customization

- Game difficulty and plant growth parameters can be customized by modifying the variables in the code. This allows for the creation of different game levels.

- Flutter SDK
- Dart
